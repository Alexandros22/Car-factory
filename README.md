# Car-factory
A program in Java that simulates a production line in a car factory. 


In order to run the project after you clone the repository, from Car_factory directory do the following:

### Step 1

javac ./par_autok/Main.java

### Step 2

java par_autok.Main

So when the program starts running a menu will appear with the following options:

1) Insert
2) Car production
3) Print
4) Delete
5) Exit

In the production line we have 3 stages: 
1) First stage: puts the body in the car.
2) Second stage: puts the engine in the car.
3) Third stage: puts the wheels in the car.

All the parts(bodies, engines, wheels) have a unique serial number and have to insert them in the program before you use them in the
production line.

After the car is completed, it is stored in the storage. Later on you can print and delete it from the archives.
