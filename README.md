# Car-factory
A program in Java that simulates a simple production line in a car factory. That means that we have a production line with 3 stages: 
1) First stage: puts the body in the car.
2) Second stage: puts the engine in the car.
3) Third stage: puts the wheels in the car.

All the parts(bodies, engines, wheels) have a unique serial number and have to insert them in the program before you use them in the
production line.

After the car is completed, it stored in the storage.
